\section*{Symbols}

\(t\) denotes a discrete time step.
\(b\Tt\) is the value of variable~\(b\) at time~\(t\).
When unambiguous, \(b\) and~\(b\nxt\) are short notations for~\(b\Tt\) and~\(b\Tp\) respectively.

\(\distribover{\cB}\) is the set of distributions over finite set~\(\cB\).
For~\(\beta \in \distribover{\cB}\), \(B \drawn \beta\) denotes that the random variable~\(B\) is drawn according to distribution~\(\beta\).
\(\probaof[\beta]{E}\) is the probability of event~\(E\) under distribution~\(\beta\).
\(\beta \elmt {b}\) denotes the quantity~\(\probaof[\beta]{B = b}\).
\(\expectof[\beta]{B}\) is the expected value of~\(B\) under distribution~\(\beta\).

\(\cI\) is a set of agents and~\(i\) denotes one agent.
\(-i\) represents the set of all agents excluding agent~\(i\), \ie, \(\cI \setminus \set{i}\).
If \(\cB\Ii\) is a set associated with agent~\(i\), \(\cB\) denotes the Cartesian product~\(\prod\idxin{i}{\cI} \cB\Ii\).
If \(b\Ii\) is a variable associated with agent~\(i\), \(b\) denotes the tuple~\(\tuple{\sseqcom{b}{\ag}{1}{2}{\card{\cI}}}\).
